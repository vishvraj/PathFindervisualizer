This project is about Pathfinding Visualizer.

![Pathfinding demo](https://github.com/vishvraj/PathFindervisualizer/assets/87961594/d669d7dc-7f97-4798-9e28-0bcbcc411751)

Which is more like a pathfinding game model in this user can create any type of maze and the Main node(starting node) will reach to end node by creating its path using Dijkstra algo in each scenerio.

Every code and algorithms like dijkstra.js are present in a folder inside main folder src.

For this i have used react App.

TO RUN THIS PROJECT ON LOCAL MACHINE:

First intall react app and run in local enviroment and replace the src folder with this src folder present in my git repo.

thanks.
